This is a minimalistic Employee Management Application built on the **Microservice Architecture**

There are two services so far
- Department Service
- Employee Service

### Microservice Communication
In a Spring Context, microservices can communicate through different channels

1. **RestTemplate** - To make REST API calls from one microservice to another microservice
2. **Webclient** - Also makes REST API calls from one microservice to another microservice
3. **Spring Cloud OpenFeign** - A spring enabler used to make REST API calls from one microservice to another microservice


#### Communication Styles
There are two main styles of communication

1. **Synchronous Communication**: The client sends a request and waits for a response from the service. The important point here is that the protocol(HTTP/HTTPS) is synchronous and the client code can only continue its task when it receives the HTTP server response. You can achieve this communication by using RestTemplate, Webclient and Spring Cloud Open Feign.

2. **Asynchronous Communication**: The client sends a request and does not wait for a response from the service. The client will continue executing its task, without waiting for a response from the service. This client does this using something called a Message Broker. You can achieve this communication by using RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka.
